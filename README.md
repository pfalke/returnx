This is a programming excercise. The aim is to create a Python tool with functionality similiar to followup.cc!

The app runs on Google App Engine and receives/sends mail via Mandrill, using parsedatetime and dateutil.

To fork the project, note that you need include your own Mandrill API Key a config.py file.

Feel free to contact me.
